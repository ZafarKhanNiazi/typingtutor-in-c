typing-tutor-in-C
A Typing Tutor is a simple application developed in C to enhance the typing speed and accuracy of beginners. This project was done as a project to demonstrate the skills that we acquired after learning C programming in 3rd Semester of my Engineering Course.The main target of the project is to program a typing tutor for the begineers of computer user. Though we have set a target group while programming , the program also provides a flexible room for it's usage by experts after improving it. We have tried to make sourcecode easier to understand by adding comments on it. Keeping in mind the limited time while programming we have tried to include as much features as we could. For better typing and to make user friendly with the keyboard without giving a glance on it while typing, we have included a user interactive keyboard on the screen. For the users flexibility, we have even added mouse feature to the typing tutor.We have tried to make the program more balanced ,accurate,credible. In overall, the mini project is successful in meeting our targets.
